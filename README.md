# travel-service

The final project requires you to build a new air travel service web application.
The application should offer a travel service portal for customers to search for flights, view results, and book air tickets.
Users should be required to create an account prior to booking the tickets.
Specifically, your project consists of the development of a Java-based web application using core frameworks such as Spring Boot. 
You will also need to implement a local database technology for flight booking and local XML files for user registration and authentication. 
In this assignment, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following course outcomes:

• Determine best strategies for overcoming identified requirements and challenges in designing distributed web applications

• Integrate existing web services into web applications successfully to address user selections

• Defend the appropriateness of methodologies for efficiently interfacing web applications with local databases

• Design logical data schemas using extensible markup language for use in distributed systems
